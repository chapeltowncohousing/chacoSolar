Based on architectural drawings, the south facing roofspace available was estimated.
The first stage was to digitise the pdfs into simple block representations of the buildings and highlight south-facing roofs, as illustrated in the figure below. 

```{r}
knitr::include_graphics("layout-south-facing-with-scale.png")
```

This was georectified and digitised in QGIS, resulting in the following data:

```{r, message=FALSE}
solars = sf::read_sf("solars.geojson")
buildings = sf::read_sf("chaco-buildings.geojson")
tm_shape(buildings) +
  tm_fill("grey") +
  tm_shape(solars) +
  tm_polygons(col = "red") +
  tm_view(basemaps = leaflet::providers$OpenStreetMap.BlackAndWhite)
```

The total maximum area available, for the terrace, common house and the entire shed roof area, respectively, was calculated as follows:

```{r}
sf::st_area(solars)
```
